>### 带to 的情态动词
 	
带to 的情态动词有四个：ought to, have to, used to, be to, 如加上have got to ,(=must), be able to，为六个。它们的疑问，否定形式应予以注意： <br>
Do they have to pay their bill before the end of the month? <br>
She didn't use to play tennis before she was fourteen. <br>
You ought not to have told her all about it. <br>
Ought he to see a heart specialist at once.?

ought to 本身作为情态动词使用。其他的词作为实义动词使用，变疑问，否定时，须有do 等助动词协助。

典型例题 <br>
Tom ought not to *___* me your secret, but he meant no harm.　<br>
A.have told　B.tell　C.be telling　D. having told <br>
答案A。由于后句为过去时，告诉秘密的动作又发生在其前因，此地应用过去完成时，但它在情态动词 ought to 后，所以用have。
