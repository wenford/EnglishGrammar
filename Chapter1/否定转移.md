>### 否定转移
 	
1. 将think, believe, suppose, expect, fancy, imagine等动词后面宾语从句的否定词转移到主句中，即主句的谓语动词用否定式，而从句的谓语动词用肯定式。 <br>
I don't think I know you.　我想我并不认识你。 <br>
I don' t believe he will come.　我相信他不回来。 <br>
注意：若谓语动词为hope,宾语从句中的否定词不能转移。 <br>
I hope you weren't ill. 我想你没有生病吧。 <br>

2. 将seem, appear 等后的从句的否定转移到前面。 <br>
It doesn't seem that they know where to go. <br>
看来他们不知道往哪去。 <br>
It doesn't appear that we'll have a sunny day tomorrow. <br>
看来我们明天不会碰上好天气。

3. 有时将动名词，介词短语或整个从句的否定转变为对谓语动词的否定。 <br>
I don't remember having ever seen such a man.　  <br>
我记得从未见过这样一个人。 (not否定动名词短语 having…) <br>
It's not a place where anyone would expect to see strange characters on the street.  <br>
在这里，人们不会想到在街上会碰上陌生的人。
(anyone 作主语，从句中的谓语动词不能用否定形式。)

4. 有时状语或状语从句中否定可以转移到谓语动词前。 <br>
The ant is not gathering this for itself alone.　(否定状语)蚂蚁不只是为自己采食。 <br>
He was not ready to believe something just because Aristotle said so. (否定because状语) 他并不因亚里斯多德说过如何如何，就轻信此事。 <br>
