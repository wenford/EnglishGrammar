>### 强调句结构
 	
常考的强调句结构是it 引导的句子。 <br>
It is (was) 被强调部分+ that (who) + 句子其他部分。 <br>

此结构强调的成分仅限于主语，宾语和状语。 <br>
It is from the sun that we get light and heat. <br>
It was not until I had read your letter that I understood the true state of affairs. <br>

典型例题 <br>
1） It was last night *___* I see the comet. <br>
A.　the time　B.　when　 C.　that　　D.　which <br>
答案C. 强调句的结构是： It +be +强调部分 + that (who) + 主谓句。 <br>强调句的连词只有两个，that和who。当强调的部分是人，且为句子的主语时，才用 "who"，其余用that。 <br>

原句：　My father did the experiment in the lab yesterday evening. <br>
强调主语： It was my father who did the experiment in the lab yesterday evening. <br>
强调宾语： It was the experiment that my father did in the lab yesterday evening. <br>
强调时间： It was yesterday evening that my father did the experiment in the lab. (注意不用when) <br>
强调地点： It was in the lab that my father did the experiment yesterday evening.  <br>

2）It is ten years *___* Miss Green returned to Canada.  <br>
A. that　B. when　 C. since　 D. as <br>
答案C. 考点是连词用法。 本题易误选为A. that. 其实本句不是强调句。若是，去掉It　 be… that还应是一个完整的句子。而本句去掉 'It is…that'，只剩下ten years Miss Green returned to Canada. 不成句。因此本句不是强调句。 <br>
It is /was +时间+ since…　其中is<---> has been　 was <---> had been.
