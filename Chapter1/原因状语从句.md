>### 原因状语从句
 	
比较：because, since, as和for 

1. because语势最强，用来说明人所不知的原因，回答why提出的问题。当原因是显而易见的或已为人们所知，就用as或 since。 <br>
I didn't go, because I was afraid. <br>
Since /As the weather is so bad, we have to delay our journey.

2. 由because引导的从句如果放在句末，且前面有逗 号，则可以用for来代替。但如果不是说明直接原因，而是多种情况加以推断，就只能用for。 <br>
He is absent today, because / for he is ill. <br>
He must be ill, for he is absent today.
