>### 比较since和for
 	
Since 用来说明动作起始时间，for用来说明动作延续时间长度。 <br>
I have lived here for more than twenty years. <br>
I have lived here since I was born.. <br>
My aunt has worked in a clinic since 1949.　  <br>
Some new oilfields have been opened up since 1976.  <br>
I have known Xiao Li since she was a little girl.　  <br>
My brother has been in the Youth League for two years.　 <br>
I have not heard from my uncle for a long time. <br>

注意：并非有for 作为时间状语的句子都用现在完成时。 <br>
I worked here for more than twenty years.  <br>
(我现在已不在这里工作。) <br>
I have worked here for many years.　<br>
(现在我仍在这里工作。) <br>

小窍门：　当现在完成时+一段时间，这一结构中，我们用下面的公式转化，很容易就能排除非延续动词在完成时中的误使。 <br>
　　1)　(对) Tom has studied Russian for three years.
　　　 = Tom began to study Russian three years ago, and is still studying it now. <br>
　　2)　(错) Harry has got married for six years.
　　　 = Harry began to get married six years ago, and is still getting married now. <br>
　　显然，第二句不对，它应改为 Harry got married six years ago.　或 Harry has been married for six years.
