>### 并列连词与并列结构
 	
并列连词引导两个并列的句子。
1. and 与or <br>
判断改错： <br>
(错) They sat down and talk about something. <br>
(错) They started to dance and sang. <br>
(错) I saw two men sitting behind and whisper there. <br>
(对) They sat down and talked about something. <br>
(对) They started to dance and sing. <br>
(对)I saw two men sitting behind and whispering there. <br>
解析：  <br>
第一句： and 连接两个并列的谓语，所以 talk 应改为 talked。 <br>
第二句：and 连接两个并列的动词不定式，第二个不定式往往省略to，因此sang 应改为 sing。 <br>
第三句：and 连接感观动词saw 后面的用作的宾补的两个并列分词结构，因此whisper应改为whispering。
注意：and 还可以和祈使句或名词词组连用表示条件。（or也有此用法） <br>
Make up your mind, and you'll get the chance. <br>
= If you make up your mind, you'll get the chance.
One more effort, and you'll succeed. <br>
= If you make one more effort, you'll succeed.

2. both …and　两者都 <br>
She plays (both) the piano and the guitar.

3. not only…but (also), as well as不但…而且） <br>
She plays not only the piano, but (also) the guitar. <br>
注意： not only… but also 关联两个分句时，一个分句因有否定词not 而必须倒装。 <br>
Not only does he like reading stories, but also he can even write some.

4. neithe…nor 意思为"既不……也不……"谓语动词采用就近原则，与nor后的词保持一致。 <br>
Neither you nor he is to blame.
