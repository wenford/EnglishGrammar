>### 主谓一致中的靠近原则
 	
1. 当there be 句型的主语是一系列事物时，谓语应与最邻近的主语保持一致。 <br>
There is a pen, a knife and several books on the desk.. <br>
There are twenty boy-students and twenty-three girl-students in the class.

2. 当either… or… 与neither… nor，　连接两个主语时，谓语动词与最邻近的主语保持一致。 如果句子是由here, there引导，而主语又不止一个时，谓语通常也和最邻近的主语一致。 <br>
Either you or she is to go. <br>
Here is a pen, a few envelops and some paper for you.
