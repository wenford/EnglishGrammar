>### what/whatever;that/what; who/whoever
 	
1. what = the thing which；whatever = anything <br>
What you want has been sent here. <br>
Whatever you want makes no difference to me. 
2. who = the person that　 whoever = anyone who <br>
（错）Who breaks the law will be punished. <br>
（错）Whoever robbed the bank is not clear. <br>
（对）Whoever breaks the law will be punished. <br>
（对）Who robbed the bank is not clear.
3. that 和 what <br>
当that引导定语从句时 ，通常用作关系代词，而引导名词性从句时，是个不充当任何成分的连接词。宾语从句和表语从句中的that常可省略。What只能引导名词性从　句， 用作连接代词，作从句的具体成分，且不能省略。 <br>
I think (that) you will like the stamps. <br>
What we need is more practice.
