>### 倒装句之部分倒装

部分倒装是指将谓语的一部分如助动词或情态倒装至主语之前。如果句中的谓语没有助动词或情态动词，则需添加助动词do, does或did，并将其置于主语之前。

1. 句首为否定或半否定的词语，如no, not, never, seldom, little, hardly, at no time, in no way, not until… 等。 <br>
Never have I seen such a performance. <br>
Nowhere will you find the answer to this question. <br>
Not until the child fell asleep did the mother leave the room. <br>
当Not until引出主从复合句，主句倒装，从句不倒装。 <br>
注意： 如否定词不在句首不倒装。 <br>
I have never seen such a performance. <br>
The mother didn't leave the room until the child fell asleep. <br>

典型例题　　 

1. Why can't I smoke here? <br>
At no time *___* in the meeting-room <br>
A. is smoking permitted　　B.　smoking is permitted <br>
C. smoking is it permitted　D.　does smoking permit <br>
答案A. 这是一个倒装问题。当否定词语置于句首以表示强调时，其句中的主谓须用倒装结构。 这些否定词包括no, little, hardly, seldom, never, not only, not until等。本题的正常语序是 Smoking is permitted in the meeting-room at no time. <br>

2. Not until the early years of the 19th century *___* what heat is. <br>
A. man did know　 B. man know　 C. didn't man know　 D. did man know <br>
答案D.　 看到Not until…的句型，我们知道为一倒装句，答案在C，D 中选一个。 <br>
改写为正常语序为，Man did not know what heat is until the early years of the 19th. 现在将not提前，后面就不能再用否定了,否则意思就变了。
