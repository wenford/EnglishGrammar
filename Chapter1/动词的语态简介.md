>### 动词的语态

语态有两种：主动语态和被动语态。 <br>
主语是动作的发出者为主动语态；主语是动作的接受者为被动语态。 <br>
1. 若宾语补足语是不带to 的不定式，变为被动语态　时，该不定式前要加"to"。此类动词为感官动词。

The teacher made me go out of the classroom. <br>
--> I was made to go out of the classroom (by the teacher). <br>
We saw him play football on the playground. <br>

2. 情态动词+ be +过去分词，构成被动语态。 <br>
