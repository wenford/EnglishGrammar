关系代词引导的定语从句
关系代词在从句中充当主语、宾语、定语（whose, which）。表示人时用who（主格/宾格）, whom（宾格，也就是动词或介词的宾语）, that, whose（所有格）；表示物时用which, that, whose。（注意that和whose既可表人也可表物），另外which可以指代前面整个句子；注意，介词后宾语表人用whom，表物用which，若是表所有格，用whose。
特别注意：what不能引导定语从句，只能引导名词性从句。

我们来看以下几个例句：
The girl who/that is standing at the gate is an English teacher. 
(who或that作从句的主语, 表人)
That’s not Tom who/that is sitting next to John. (who或that作从句的主语, 表人)
=That’s not Tom. Tom is sitting next to John.
The girl whom/who/that Peter is talking to is a teacher. (whom作从句宾语,表人)
The girl to whom Peter is talking is a teacher. (介词可以前置)
The girl to who/that× Peter is talking to is a teacher.×
（当介词前置时，表人只能用whom）
(人) The girl (whose mother is a nurse) is a teacher. 
(whose与它所修饰的名词一起构成一个名词短语在从句中担当成分)
(物) The book (whose cover is missing) is very funny. (不可分割的一部分, 指物时可用of which来代替)
        = The book, the cover of which is missing, is very funny.
   The room (whose door faces south) is very bright. (物质所属)
       = The room, the door of which faces south, is very bright.
The book (which/that belongs to me) is missing.（which/that作从句主语，表物）
I don't like the novel (that/which you are reading). 
(that/which作从句动词的宾语，表物)

which的特殊用法
He was late for school again, which made the teacher very angry. (which指代前面整个句子，作从句的主语)。
He advised me to hide behind the door, which advice I took at once. (which作定语)
She had a little money in the bank, with which to help her mother. (which与不定式连用，构成定语短语)

介词+关系代词例句（包括介词前置）：

注意介词的选择，要根据从句来确定，不能受主句影响！
This is the room in which I live.
先行词room在从句中要加上介词in作地点状语，也就是作in的宾语。从句还原应该是I live in the room.
此句也可以转换成：This is the room which I live in.
I have paid for the house in which he lived.
注意此句不能用for which，分析此句时，先确定先行词the house，其次确定the house或which在从句中要加介词in作状语。不能受主句中the house前介词for的影响。
The man (to whom you talked just now) will chair the meeting tomorrow.
= The man (whom/who you talked to just now) will chair the meeting tomorrow.
He told me the tickets are hard to buy, in which case you’d better buy right now.
(which作case的定语)
He told me the tickets are hard to buy, and you’d better buy right now in that case.
The books, some of which he has read, are very interesting. 表示整体与部分关系
The books are very interesting and he has read some of the book.
The students, most of whom have seen the movie, are from our class.
The students are from our class and most of them have seen the movie.
He spent 2 hours there, during which time he slept.
He spent 2 hours there and he slept during that time.
The boss in whose department Mr. King worked had a heart attack.
The boss had a heart attack.  Mr. King worked in his department.

但注意，在固定短语中介词不能提前，比如：care for, call on, put off, listen to, look for, look after等，如果把它们拆开，那么这些短语就失去了原来的含意。
The old man whom I am looking after is better.
