虚拟语气在主语从句中的用法。
  	在“It is + 形容词important (strange, natural, necessary)  that…”这类句型中，that所引导的主语从句中的谓语动词常用 “(should)+动词原形”结构，should可以省略，表示某事是“重要”，“奇怪”，“自然”，“必要”等意义。
或在“It is suggested, advised, ordered that…” 这类句子中，也就是上面宾语从句中相关动词的被动形式的主语从句中，谓语动词也要用should do，should可省。如：
  	It is important that every Beijinger (should) be able to  speak English. 重要的是每个北京人能说英语。
It is necessary that he (should) be sent to hospital at once. 有必要马上把他送医院。
It is suggested that you set out immediately.
