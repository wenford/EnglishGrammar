同位从句
与先行词同位或同等的从句称为同位语从句，具体说明先行词的内容。同位语从句就是在复合句中作名词的同位语的名词性从句。
同位语从句usage and example
　同位语从句对于名词进一步解释，说明名词的具体内容，一般由that引导
1. He accepted the fact that she would never come back.
2. She came to the conclusion that she must act at once.
3. I have no doubt that you were telling the truth.
4. Do you have any ideas where we can get cheaper secondhand car?
5. Nobody can explain the mystery why he suddenly disappeared.

注意：
同位语前的先行词通常为news, fact, doubt, conclusion, hope, decision, belief, promise, truth, report, idea, possibility, opinion, proof, message, impression, evidence, feeling, thought, story, order等等
用正常的陈述语气
有时与前面的先行词分开
Word came that the enemies had got to he foot of the mountain.
His dream came true that he would become a world famous footballer.
同位语从句与定语从句的区别
位语从句中that只起连接作用，在从句中不充当任何成分，定语从句中that是关系代词，除了连接主句与从句外，还在从句中充当主语或宾语
This is the truth that he told me.
This is the truth that he is the right man for the job.
位语从句中先行词去掉后不影响句子的理解；而定语从句先行词不能去掉。
I believe the fact that he was honest.
= I believe that he was honest.
I believe the fact he thought to be true.
I believe he thought to be true,
同位语从句中先行词是表示抽象概念的词，而定语从句中的先行词可以是表抽象或具体概念的词
同位语从句中的that不能省略，而定语从句中的that在从句中作宾语时可省略
