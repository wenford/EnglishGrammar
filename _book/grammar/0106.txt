练习：
A. where, B. which, C. that, D. the one, E. /
Is this museum ____ they visited yesterday?
Is this the museum ____ they visited yesterday?
Is this museum ____ they stayed yesterday?
Is this the museum ____ they stayed yesterday?
Is this museum ____ you visited beautiful?
It was the museum ____ you saw many treasures.
It was in the museum ____ you saw many treasures.
It was in the museum ____ you dropped in that you saw many treasures.

答案：
首先注意，做疑问句时，要把句子先转化成陈述句，再来判断句子结构。
D
此句的陈述应为：This museum is ______ they visited yesterday
定语从句三步曲：
1．确定先行词。此句谓语动词is后并没有名词或代词来充当先行词，所以两种可能，其一，此题不是定语从句，为名词性从句，填what；其二，加上先行词the one成为定语从句，再加关系词that，而此处that作visit的宾语，可省，所以选D
BCE   
先变为陈述句：This is the museum …为定语从句，先行词museum，作从句visit宾语，关系代词可选which, that或省略
A   
This museum is … 此句不是定语从句，没有先行词，为状语从句，表地点，where引导
A   
This is the museum … 此句为定语从句，先行词museum，但要注意museum作从句的状语，因为stay为不及物动词，必须说stay at the museum，所以，此处可用at which或where。
BCE   
同第二句，主干为This museum is beautiful.定语从句修饰主语museum。
A   
此句为定语从句，先行词做从句状语，where来引导
C  
此句为强调句，去掉It was和that，再把语序调一下，构成完整的句子。 
A
此句为强调句+定语从句，见下面的定语从句中的难点讲解。
注意drop in为不及物动词短语，要说drop in on sb. 或drop in at a place

定语从句练习中的难点
除了以上的十点需特别注意外，定语从句练习中还要小心下面的情况：
陷阱题。
从句迷惑主句结构的判断
The person we spoke to ____ no answer at first． 
A．making   B．makes   C．make   D．made
对于此题，一些粗心的学生看到to马上就选择C。实际上we spoke to是定语从句，修饰the person，主句的主干应该是The person made no answer.应该选D。

The man whose songs we are fond of ____ in our city next week． 
A．singing  B．to sing  C．will sing  D．sang
同样，此题易误选A，以为是be fond of singing，实际上whose songs we are fond of 为定语，句子主干为The man will sing in our city.

主句从句结构混杂在一起
Everything he ____ away from him before he returned to his hometown. 
A. took   B. had been taken   C. had had been taken    D. had taken
此句对于一些基础差的学生有一定难度，他们无法正确判断句子的结构，容易误选A或D。但实际上，此题是主句和从句的结构相互混杂。Everything为先行词，he had为定语从句修饰everything，主句主干为Everything had been taken away. 因此应选C。

定语从句和强调句混杂在一起
定语从句和强调句本身就容易混淆，如果把两者加在一起就更容易混淆了，做题时，关键是要判断定语从句的范围。如以下这个句子：
It was in this building ______ I once worked _____ he met his former classmate.

It was in this building (where I once worked) that he met his former classmate.
再如上面的随堂练习第八题。
