特殊的定语从句
It/This　is　+the+序数词+时间+ (that) +定语从句（从句用完成时）
It　is　the　first　time　（that）　I　have　been　here.
It is (high) time +that+定语从句
It is time that we should go home.	
It is time that we went home 
the way+定语从句，the way做从句状语时，通常省略关系词或用that/in which
The way (that/in which) he is doing the experiment is very funny.
time, moment, second, minute等后，通常用that来代替when引导定语从句，并且常省略
The moment he arrives, I will ring you up.  (that/when)常省略
By the time John came, Peter had finished his work. (that/when常省略)
But作为关系代词（了解即可），相当于that(who) … not
There are very few but admire his talents. 很少有人不佩服他的才华。

定语从句的省略和主谓一致
定语从句的省略：
定语从句除了上述特殊定语从句中的2、3点两种情况的省略外，主要是当关系代词在定语从句中充当宾语时可省，注意，只有做宾语时才能省。（但如果是介词前置，则不可省）
The novel (which/that) he wrote is interesting.
The man (who/whom) Tom is talking with is a teacher in our school.

定语从句的主谓一致：
1．当关系代词作定语从句的主语时，定语从句中的谓语动词在人称和数上要和先行词一致。
   I know the student who is your classmate.
   The students who are my classmates are going to help the old man.
2．“one of＋可数名词复数”引导的定语从句中,谓语动词应用复数；而“one of＋可数名词复数”前有the，only或the only修饰，定语从句中的谓语动词用单数。
 　　He is one of the students who study very hard at school.
 　　He is the (only/the only) one of the students who studies very hard at school.
