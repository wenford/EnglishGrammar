Noun Clause 名词性从句

定语从句的基本知识
定义：由连接词引导，在句子中起名词作用的从句叫名词性从句。名词从句的功能相当于名词词组, 它在复合句中能担任主语、宾语（动词、介词宾语）、表语、同位语等。

名词性从句与定语从句区别：
它们的性质不同，一个是名词，而另一个是形容词性。名词性从句是独立的，而定语从句必须要依附先行词（相当于寄身虫）。有时名词性从句可以转换成定语从句（必须加先行词）。比如：What he said = The things that he said

名词性从句的构成：
构成一个名词性从句就象是对一个陈述句进行特殊疑问句的提问，只不过不颠倒语序，如：
He said something.    What he said （名词性从句）  What did he say? (特殊疑问句)

分类：
根据从句在句中不同的语法功能，名词性从句又可分别称为主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句和同位语从句四种。
根据引导名词性从句的连接词可分为三类：
连接词：  that, whether, if （不充当从句的任何成分）
连接代词：who, what, which, whose, whoever, whichever, whomever, whatever  
连接副词：where, when, why, how (how much, how long…), wherever, whenever, however

主语从句
例句：
That prices will go up is certain.		= It is certain that prices will go up.
How you travel means the difference between success and failure.
Whether we go by train or by boat makes no difference.
Who will write the poem has not been decided yet.
What surprised us is that he lost in the game.
What he left us was a large sum of money.
When he will be back depends on the weather.
Where we live doesn’t matter.
How the pyramids were built was still a mystery.
10. Watever he did is right.
11. Whoever comes will be welcome.
12. Whichever you want is yours.

注意点：
That引导的主语从句中，that不能省略。
主语从句可以用it来做形式主语，然后把从句放在主句之后，使句子更平衡。如例句第1,3,4,8,9.
主谓一致
1．只有一套主谓结构的主语从句，谓语用单数
How and when language began is a mystery.
2．含有两套主谓结构并列出现于主语从句时，用复数
How he’s got the car and whether it is new are not known yet.
what引导的主语从句，谓语随表语变
What you need is more practice.
What you need are the books on the desk.
