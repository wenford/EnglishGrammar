# 分词的时态
1）与主语动词同时， <br>
　Hearing the news, he jumped with joy.　 听到这一消息，他高兴得手舞足蹈。<br>
　Arriving there, they found the boy dead.　刚一到那儿，他们就发现那男孩死了。<br>
<br>
典型例题<br>
　　The secretary worked late into the night, ___a long speech for the president. <br>
A. to prepare　 B. preparing　 C. prepared　 D. was preparing　<br>
　　答案B. 此处没有连词，不能选D，否则出现了两个谓语动词worked和was preparing。 只能在B，C中选一个。又因前后两个动作同时发生，且与主语为主动关系，应用现在分词。<br>
<br>
2）先于主动词<br>
　　While walking in the garden，he hurt his leg. 在花园里散步时他伤了腿。<br>
　　分词作时间状语，如果先与主动词的动作，且强调先后， 要用having done。<br>
　　Having finished his homework, he went out.<br>
　 =As he had finished his homework, he went out.<br>
　　 做完作业后，他出去了。<br>
<br>
典型例题<br>
　　___ a reply, he decided to write again.　 <br>
A. Not receiving　　B. Receiving not　 C. Not having received　 D. Having not received　　<br>
　 答案C. 本题考查分词的时态与分词的否定式。根据题意判断，分词的动作（接信）发生在谓语动词的动作（决心再写信）之前，因此用分词的完成式。分词的否定式的构成为not +分词，故选C。该句可理解为：Because he had not received a reply, he decided to write again.<br>
